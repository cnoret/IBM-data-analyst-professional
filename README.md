# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project (2024)
Final project for the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate.

### Project Overview

This Capstone project aims to provide a practical application of the skills acquired throughout the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate program. 
By taking on the role of a Data Analyst at a global IT and Business Services firm, let's analyze various datasets to identify trends in emerging technologies.

### Project Phases

  * Data Collection (Module 1): 
        Gather data on in-demand technology skills from sources like job postings, blog posts, and surveys.
        
  * Data Wrangling (Module 2):
        Prepare the collected data for analysis by cleaning and organizing it. 
        This includes tasks such as handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

  * Data Analysis (Module 3):
        Apply statistical techniques to analyze the data and extract meaningful insights. 
        This involves identifying top programming languages, database skills, IDEs, and demographic trends among developers.

  * Data Visualization (Module 4):
        Choose appropriate visualizations (charts, plots, histograms) to effectively communicate the findings and trends.

  * Interactive Dashboard Creation (Module 5):
        Utilize Cognos to build interactive dashboards that allow for dynamic analysis and presentation of the data.

  * Storytelling and Presentation (Module 6):
        Develop a compelling narrative to present the findings of your analysis. 
        Use a provided presentation template to structure your story and deliver a persuasive presentation.
